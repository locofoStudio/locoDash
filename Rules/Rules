# Professional Software Standards
You MUST ensure that your code adheres to ALL of the following principles:

1. **Best Practices:**  
   - Optimize for performance, maintainability, readability, and modularity.

2. **Functional Modularity:**  
   - Design well-defined, reusable functions to handle discrete tasks.  
   - Each function must have a single, clear purpose to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.

3. **File Modularity:**  
   - Organize your codebase across multiple files to reduce complexity and enforce a black-box design.  
   - Intentionally isolate core modules or specific functionalities into separate files when appropriate that are imported into the main executable.

4. **Comments and Documentation:**  
   - Begin EVERY file with a comment block that explains its purpose and role within the project.  
   - Document EVERY function with a comment block that describes its functionality, including inputs and outputs.  
   - Use inline comments to clarify the purpose and implementation of non-obvious code segments.  
   - For any external function calls (functions not defined within the current file), include a comment explaining their inputs, outputs, and purpose.

5. **Readability:**  
   - Use intuitive naming conventions and maintain a logical, organized structure throughout your code.

Keep these standards in mind throughout the ENTIRE duration of the request.

# Development Chain of Thought Protocol
When updating the codebase, you must adhere to the following strict protocol to avoid unauthorized changes that could introduce bugs or break functionality. Your actions must be constrained by explicit mode instructions to prevent inadvertent modifications.

## Protocol

- **Mode Transitions:**  
  - **Restriction:** You will start in 'RESEARCH' mode, and only transition modes when explicitly told by me to change using the exact key phrases `MODE: (mode name)`.
  - **Important:** You must declare your current mode at the beginning of every response.

- **Modes and Their Rules:**

  - **MODE 1: RESEARCH**  
    - **Purpose:** Gather information about the codebase without suggesting or planning any changes.  
    - **Allowed:** Reading files, asking clarifying questions, requesting additional context, understanding code structure.  
    - **Forbidden:** Suggestions, planning, or implementation.  
    - **Output:** Exclusively observations and clarifying questions.

  - **MODE 2: INNOVATE**  
    - **Purpose:** Brainstorm and discuss potential approaches without committing to any specific plan.
    - **Allowed:** Discussing ideas, advantages/disadvantages, and seeking feedback.  
    - **Forbidden:** Detailed planning, concrete implementation strategies, or code writing.  
    - **Output:** Only possibilities and considerations.

  - **MODE 3: PLAN**  
    - **Purpose:** Create a detailed technical specification for the required changes.  
    - **Allowed:** Outlining specific file paths, function names, and change details.  
    - **Forbidden:** Any code implementation or example code.  
    - **Requirement:** The plan must be comprehensive enough to require no further creative decisions during implementation.  
    - **Checklist Requirement:** Conclude with a numbered, sequential implementation checklist:
      
      ```markdown
      IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
      1. [Specific action 1]
      2. [Specific action 2]
      ...
      n. [Final action]
      ```
    - **Output:** Exclusively the specifications and checklist.

  - **MODE 4: EXECUTE**  
    - **Purpose:** Implement exactly what was detailed in the approved plan.  
    - **Allowed:** Only actions explicitly listed in the plan.
    - **Forbidden:** Any modifications, improvements, or creative additions not in the plan.    
    - **Deviation Handling:** If any issue arises that requires deviation from the plan, immediately revert to PLAN mode.  

- **General Notes:**  
  - You are not permitted to act outside of these defined modes.
  - In all modes, avoid making assumptions or independent decisions; follow explicit instructions only.
  - If there is any uncertainty or if further clarification is needed, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

# Systematic Code Refactoring Protocol
You will execute a comprehensive, safety-first code refactoring process using a structured methodology that preserves functionality while improving code quality. This protocol ensures systematic analysis, incremental implementation, and continuous user oversight.

### Phase Structure
You must progress through phases sequentially, obtaining explicit user approval before advancing. Each phase has specific deliverables and constraints.

---

## PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT
**Purpose:** Analyze the target code to identify refactoring opportunities and establish baseline understanding.

**Process:**
1. **Code Analysis Checklist:**
   - Document current functionality and expected behavior
   - Identify code smells using established patterns (Long Method, Large Class, Duplicate Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, etc.)
   - Assess cyclomatic complexity and coupling/cohesion metrics
   - Map dependencies and external interfaces
   - Review existing tests and coverage

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **HIGH RISK:** Changes affecting public APIs, core business logic, or external integrations
   - **MEDIUM RISK:** Internal method restructuring, variable renaming, or class reorganization  
   - **LOW RISK:** Code formatting, comment improvements, or minor variable scope adjustments

3. **Refactoring Opportunity Matrix:**
   ```
   PRIORITY | CODE SMELL | COMPLEXITY | RISK LEVEL | ESTIMATED EFFORT
   High     | [Issue]    | [1-5]      | [H/M/L]    | [Time estimate]
   ```

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive assessment report with prioritized refactoring opportunities and risk analysis.

**Constraint:** NO code changes permitted in this phase. Analysis only.

---

## PHASE 2: PLANNING
**Purpose:** Create detailed implementation roadmap with specific steps and validation criteria.

**Process:**
1. **Scope Definition:**
   - Select specific refactoring targets based on user priorities
   - Define success criteria for each selected improvement
   - Establish functional preservation requirements
   - Identify required test cases for validation

2. **Implementation Sequence:**
   - Order changes from lowest to highest risk
   - Define atomic change units (single refactoring per commit)
   - Establish rollback points and undo strategies
   - Plan validation steps for each change

3. **Change Specification:**
   For each planned refactoring:
   ```markdown
   **Refactoring:** [Name/Type]
   **Target:** [Specific code location]
   **Method:** [Specific refactoring technique]
   **Expected Outcome:** [Measurable improvement]
   **Validation:** [How success will be verified]
   **Rollback:** [Undo procedure if needed]
   ```

**Deliverable:** Detailed implementation plan with sequenced steps and validation criteria.

**Constraint:** NO code changes permitted. Planning only.

---

## PHASE 3: INCREMENTAL EXECUTION
**Purpose:** Implement planned refactoring through carefully controlled, incremental changes.

**Process Rules:**
- **Single Change Principle:** Implement only ONE refactoring at a time
- **Validation Requirement:** Verify functionality after each change before proceeding
- **User Checkpoint:** Request approval after every 3 changes or before high-risk modifications
- **Documentation Mandate:** Document rationale and impact for each change

**Per-Change Protocol:**
1. **Pre-Implementation:**
   - State the specific change being made
   - Confirm it matches the approved plan
   - Identify validation method

2. **Implementation:**
   - Make the minimal necessary code change
   - Preserve all existing functionality
   - Maintain consistent code style
   - Add appropriate comments/documentation

3. **Post-Implementation:**
   - Verify the change compiles/runs without errors
   - Confirm existing tests still pass
   - Document the completed change
   - Present before/after comparison

4. **Validation Checkpoint:**
   - Summarize what was changed and why
   - Confirm functionality preservation
   - Request user approval to continue

**Emergency Protocol:**
If ANY unexpected behavior occurs:
- **STOP immediately**
- Document the issue
- Propose rollback to last known good state
- Request user guidance before proceeding

---

## PHASE 4: VALIDATION & DOCUMENTATION
**Purpose:** Comprehensive verification of refactoring success and complete documentation.

**Process:**
1. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Run complete test suite
   - Verify all original functionality preserved
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Performance comparison (if applicable)

2. **Quality Metrics:**
   - Measure complexity reduction
   - Assess maintainability improvements
   - Verify adherence to coding standards
   - Document technical debt reduction

3. **Final Documentation:**
   - Refactoring summary with rationale
   - Before/after code comparisons
   - Impact assessment and benefits realized
   - Recommendations for future improvements

**Deliverable:** Complete refactoring report with validation results and comprehensive documentation.

---

## Core Constraints

**Functional Preservation:**
- NEVER modify intended behavior unless explicitly requested
- ALL existing tests must continue passing
- External interfaces must remain unchanged
- Error handling behavior must be preserved

**User Authority:**
- Request approval before implementing high-risk changes
- Stop and ask for guidance when encountering unexpected issues
- Allow user to modify scope or priorities at any checkpoint
- Provide clear options when multiple refactoring approaches exist

**Quality Standards:**
- Follow established refactoring patterns (Martin Fowler's catalog)
- Maintain or improve code readability
- Reduce complexity without increasing coupling
- Add documentation for non-obvious changes

**Safety Protocols:**
- Always have rollback plan before implementing changes
- Make atomic changes that can be easily reverted
- Test functionality after each significant modification
- Document all assumptions and decisions

Begin with PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT. Clearly state your current phase at the start of each response and obtain explicit user approval before advancing phases.

# Systematic Test Suite Development Protocol
You will create a comprehensive, production-grade test suite through systematic analysis and incremental development. This process ensures complete coverage, maintainable code, and precise failure reporting for any given codebase or functionality.

### **Phase 1: CODEBASE ANALYSIS**
Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the target code:

**1.1 Module Identification**
- Examine all files, classes, functions, and methods in scope
- Identify public interfaces, private methods, and external dependencies  
- Map data flow and component interactions
- Document entry points and critical execution paths

**1.2 Testability Assessment**
- Categorize components by test complexity: **Simple** (pure functions), **Moderate** (stateful classes), **Complex** (integration points)
- Identify external dependencies requiring mocking or stubbing
- Flag asynchronous operations, file I/O, network calls, and database interactions
- Note error-prone areas and edge case scenarios

**1.3 Test Requirement Matrix**
Create a structured breakdown:
```
MODULE: [module_name]
├── Unit Tests Required: [count]
├── Integration Tests Required: [count]  
├── Edge Cases Identified: [list]
├── Dependencies to Mock: [list]
└── Priority Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### **Phase 2: BATCH PLANNING**
Organize test development into logical, manageable batches:

**2.1 Batch Criteria**
- **Batch Size**: Maximum 5-8 test files per batch to maintain focus
- **Dependency Order**: Lower-level utilities before higher-level consumers
- **Complexity Grouping**: Simple tests before complex integration scenarios
- **Risk Prioritization**: Critical functionality first, edge cases second

**2.2 Batch Structure Template**
```
BATCH #: [number] - [descriptive_name]
├── Scope: [specific components/functionality]
├── Test Types: [unit/integration/e2e]
├── Dependencies: [required mocks/fixtures]
├── Estimated Tests: [count]
├── Prerequisites: [previous batches required]
└── Success Criteria: [coverage goals]
```

### **Phase 3: TEST IMPLEMENTATION**
For each approved batch, create production-grade tests following these standards:

**3.1 Test File Structure**
Begin every test file with:
``
/**
 * TEST SUITE: [module_name]
 * PURPOSE: [clear description of what functionality is being tested]
 * SCOPE: [specific functions/methods covered]
 * DEPENDENCIES: [external requirements, mocks, fixtures]
 * LAST UPDATED: [date]
 */
``

**3.2 Individual Test Standards**
Each test must follow the **AAA Pattern**:
``
// TEST: should_[expected_behavior]_when_[specific_condition]
test('should_return_valid_result_when_input_is_positive_integer', () => {
    // ARRANGE: Set up test data and environment
    const input = 42;
    const expected = 'positive';
    
    // ACT: Execute the function under test
    const result = classifyNumber(input);
    
    // ASSERT: Verify expected outcome with specific error messages
    expect(result).toBe(expected, 
        `Expected classifyNumber(${input}) to return '${expected}', but got '${result}'`);
});
``

**3.3 Required Test Categories**
For each function/method, implement:

- **Happy Path Tests**: Valid inputs producing expected outputs
- **Boundary Tests**: Edge values (null, undefined, empty, max/min values)  
- **Error Handling Tests**: Invalid inputs triggering appropriate error responses
- **State Tests**: For stateful objects, test state changes and side effects
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow validation

**3.4 Documentation Requirements**
- **Function Purpose**: Comment explaining what each test validates
- **Input Explanation**: Document test data choices and significance  
- **Expected Behavior**: Clear description of anticipated results
- **Failure Scenarios**: Specific error conditions and expected responses
- **Mock Justification**: Why specific dependencies are mocked and how

### **Phase 4: COVERAGE VERIFICATION**
After each batch completion:

**4.1 Coverage Analysis**
- Verify all public methods have corresponding tests
- Confirm error handling paths are exercised  
- Validate integration points are tested
- Check that edge cases are comprehensively covered

**4.2 Quality Checklist**
- [ ] All tests follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Each test has single, clear responsibility  
- [ ] Failure messages provide actionable debugging information
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] External dependencies are properly isolated
- [ ] Test data is meaningful and representative

### **Phase 5: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Conclude with a sequential deployment plan:

```
IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:
1. [Setup test environment and dependencies]
2. [Implement Batch 1: Core utilities]
3. [Implement Batch 2: Business logic]  
4. [Implement Batch 3: Integration scenarios]
...
n. [Final validation and coverage report]
```

### **Execution Protocol**
- **Incremental Approval**: Present each batch plan for approval before implementation
- **Quality Gates**: Each batch must pass quality checklist before proceeding
- **Documentation First**: Always explain test purpose before showing implementation
- **Failure Analysis**: When tests fail, provide exact location and remediation steps
- **Continuous Validation**: Verify previous batches remain functional as new tests are added

### **Output Requirements**
- Present analysis findings in structured format
- Show batch plans with clear scope and dependencies  
- Provide complete, runnable test code with comprehensive documentation
- Include specific assertions with detailed failure messages
- Deliver implementation roadmap with clear sequencing

### **Cross-Framework Adaptation Guidelines**

#### **Framework-Specific Adjustments**
- **Jest**: Use `describe`, `test`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`
- **Mocha**: Use `describe`, `it`, `before`, `after`  
- **PyTest**: Use `class Test`, `def test_`, `setup_method`, `teardown_method`
- **RSpec**: Use `describe`, `it`, `before(:all)`, `after(:all)`

#### **Language-Specific Modifications**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use JSDoc comment blocks
- **Python**: Use docstring format with triple quotes
- **Java**: Use JavaDoc with @Test annotations
- **C#**: Use XML documentation comments with [Test] attributes

This format ensures every test follows professional standards with comprehensive documentation, structured logging, complete metadata, and proper resource management regardless of the specific testing framework or programming language used.

# Testing Standards
You MUST ensure that your testing approach adheres to ALL of the following principles:

### **Testing Hierarchy & Granularity**

1. **Unit Test Standards (70% of test suite):**
   - Test ONE specific function or method per test case
   - Each test MUST be completely isolated and independent
   - Mock ALL external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
   - Test execution time MUST be under 10ms per test
   - Follow strict Arrange-Act-Assert structure

2. **Integration Test Standards (20% of test suite):**
   - Test component interactions and data flow between 2-3 modules
   - Use real implementations for components being tested
   - Mock only external system boundaries
   - Test execution time MUST be under 100ms per test

3. **End-to-End Test Standards (10% of test suite):**
   - Test complete user workflows from start to finish
   - Use production-like environments and realistic data
   - Focus on critical business paths only
   - Test execution time acceptable up to 30 seconds per test

### **Test Structure & Organization**

4. **File Organization:**
   - Mirror source code directory structure in test directories
   - Use consistent naming: ``SourceFile.test.js`` or ``test_source_file.py``
   - Group related tests in describe/context blocks with clear hierarchy
   - Separate test utilities and fixtures into dedicated files

5. **Test Naming Convention:**
   - Format: ``should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]``
   - Example: ``should_return_empty_list_when_no_items_exist``
   - Test names MUST be readable sentences describing expected behavior
   - Avoid technical jargon; focus on business behavior

6. **Test Structure Pattern:**
   ```
   // Arrange: Set up test conditions and inputs
   // Act: Execute the code being tested
   // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
   ```

### **Code Quality Standards**

7. **Test Independence (FIRST Principles):**
   - **Fast**: Each test runs in isolation under 10ms (unit) / 100ms (integration)
   - **Independent**: Tests can run in any order without affecting results
   - **Repeatable**: Same results in any environment (dev, staging, CI)
   - **Self-Validating**: Clear pass/fail with descriptive failure messages
   - **Timely**: Tests written alongside or before production code

8. **Assertion Standards:**
   - Use specific assertions over generic ones: ``expect(result).toBe(5)`` not ``expect(result).toBeTruthy()``
   - Include meaningful failure messages: ``expect(user.age, 'User age validation').toBe(25)``
   - Test both positive and negative cases for each behavior
   - Verify state changes, not implementation details

9. **Test Data Management:**
   - Use factory functions or builders for creating test objects
   - Employ realistic data that represents actual use cases
   - Create edge case data systematically (null, empty, boundary values)
   - Isolate test data creation in setup functions or fixtures

### **Maintainability & Performance**

10. **Test Maintenance:**
    - Extract common test logic into reusable helper functions
    - Use descriptive variable names that explain test scenarios
    - Keep tests DRY while maintaining individual test clarity
    - Refactor tests when production code changes, don't just make them pass

11. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Run expensive setup once per test suite, not per test
    - Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) to eliminate external dependencies
    - Implement parallel test execution where possible
    - Monitor and optimize slow-running tests continuously

12. **Documentation Requirements:**
    - Begin each test file with a comment explaining what component is being tested
    - Document complex test scenarios with inline comments
    - Include examples of expected inputs and outputs for complex test data
    - Maintain README files explaining test strategy and execution instructions

### **Quality Gates**

13. **Coverage Requirements:**
    - Minimum 80% line coverage for critical business logic
    - 100% coverage for public API methods and interfaces
    - Focus on branch coverage over line coverage for conditional logic
    - Exclude trivial getters/setters from coverage requirements

14. **Test Review Checklist:**
    - [ ] Test name clearly describes expected behavior
    - [ ] Test follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    - [ ] Test is independent and can run in isolation
    - [ ] All assertions include meaningful failure messages
    - [ ] Test data is realistic and represents actual use cases
    - [ ] External dependencies are properly mocked
    - [ ] Test execution time meets performance standards

Keep these testing standards in mind throughout the ENTIRE duration of test development and maintenance.

# Database Standards
## Style - Professional Database Standards

You MUST ensure that your database design and implementation adheres to ALL of the following principles:

### **1. Schema Design & Normalization**
- **Normalize to 3NF minimum:** Eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity through proper normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- **Primary Keys:** Every table must have a single-column surrogate primary key (preferably auto-incrementing integer or UUID).
- **Foreign Key Constraints:** Enforce referential integrity with proper CASCADE, RESTRICT, or SET NULL behaviors.
- **Data Types:** Use appropriate, specific data types (VARCHAR with limits, not TEXT; DECIMAL for currency, not FLOAT).
- **Null Handling:** Explicitly define NULL/NOT NULL constraints based on business logic requirements.

### **2. Naming Conventions**
- **Tables:** Use singular nouns in snake_case (``user``, ``order_item``, ``product_category``).
- **Columns:** Use descriptive snake_case names (``created_at``, ``email_address``, ``total_price``).
- **Indexes:** Prefix with ``idx_`` followed by table and column(s) (``idx_user_email``, ``idx_order_created_at``).
- **Constraints:** Use prefixes ``pk_`` (primary key), ``fk_`` (foreign key), ``ck_`` (check), ``uq_`` (unique).
- **Avoid:** Reserved words, abbreviations, and ambiguous names.

### **3. Performance Optimization**
- **Strategic Indexing:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns, foreign keys, and WHERE clause predicates.
- **Composite Indexes:** Order columns by selectivity (most selective first) and query patterns.
- **Query Efficiency:** Write queries that leverage indexes, avoid SELECT *, and use appropriate JOINs.
- **Execution Plans:** Consider query execution paths and optimize for minimal I/O operations.
- **Partitioning:** Implement table partitioning for large datasets based on access patterns.

### **4. Security Standards**
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions to users and applications.
- **Input Validation:** Use parameterized queries and stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with proper user authentication.
- **Audit Logging:** Track all data access and modifications with comprehensive audit trails.

### **5. Data Integrity & Constraints**
- **Business Rules:** Implement check constraints to enforce business logic at the database level.
- **Referential Integrity:** Use foreign key constraints to maintain data consistency across tables.
- **Unique Constraints:** Prevent duplicate data where business rules require uniqueness.
- **Default Values:** Provide sensible defaults for non-nullable columns (``created_at DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``).
- **Triggers:** Use sparingly and only for critical data integrity operations.

### **6. Documentation & Maintainability**
- **Table Comments:** Document the purpose and business context of each table.
- **Column Comments:** Explain non-obvious column purposes, units, and constraints.
- **Schema Versioning:** Implement database migration scripts with rollback capabilities.
- **Data Dictionary:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of all database objects and relationships.
- **Change Management:** Document all schema changes with business justification and impact analysis.

### **7. Scalability & Architecture**
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for read replicas and potential sharding requirements.
- **Connection Pooling:** Implement efficient database connection management.
- **Caching Strategy:** Consider appropriate caching layers (query result caching, object caching).
- **Backup & Recovery:** Implement automated backups with tested recovery procedures (RTO/RPO compliance).
- **Monitoring:** Set up performance monitoring and alerting for query performance and resource utilization.

### **8. Transaction Management**
- **ACID Compliance:** Ensure all transactions maintain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- **Transaction Scope:** Keep transactions as short as possible to minimize lock contention.
- **Isolation Levels:** Use appropriate isolation levels based on consistency requirements.
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Design transaction order and timing to minimize deadlock scenarios.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper transaction rollback and error recovery mechanisms.

**Critical Requirement:** Every database implementation must demonstrate adherence to these standards through explicit design decisions, proper documentation, and security-conscious practices. Prioritize long-term maintainability and scalability over short-term convenience.

## Critical Constraints

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- NO code changes may be suggested until Phase 4 is complete
- NO assumptions about root cause - only evidence-based conclusions
- Risk assessment determines validation intensity - not every bug needs exhaustive testing
- Must clearly justify confidence level and risk assessment decisions

**Safety Protocols:**
- If evidence is insufficient for confident determination, MUST proceed through investigation
- If risk level is uncertain, default to higher validation requirements
- If proposed solution has unmitigated risks regardless of level, STOP and request consultation

**Efficiency Guidelines:**
- Simple, obvious fixes with clear evidence require minimal validation
- Complex or system-wide changes require comprehensive validation
- Match testing effort to actual risk, not perceived importance

Execute Phase 1 immediately upon receiving the bug report and evidence.
